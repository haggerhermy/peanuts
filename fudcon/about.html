					<h3> We're building robots that like beer </h3>
					<p>
						Everyone knows Fedorans are awesome. Let's get that out of the way. What's to note here, is that hundreds of Fedorans, individually working (playing?) off their homes end up building something small and awesome. 

						What happens when a lot of Fedorans get together? Awesomeness happens. Let's give that a name. Say, FUDCon?

				<div class="session">
					<h3> Now it's your time to whine </h3>
					<p>
						If you're a user of a product that Fedorans have built, you should totally be here. A lot of developers will hangout, so if you want to complain, you know you now have a platform. It's optional, you could even show some love with a mug of beer ;-)
